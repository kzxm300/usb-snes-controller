This project utilizes a PIC microcontroller with USB interface as a replacement for the original connector, thereby making it possible to use it on any PC with any game.
The intention is not to modify the electronics in the controller, so it can still be used with an original Super Nintendo. Instead, only the connector is replaced.

This project consists of C source code for MCC18 compiler and [Eagle](http://www.cadsoft.de) files that describe the PCB.
